# The ZOMB file format **(!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!)**

Welcome to the ZOMB file format specification. It's basically a mix of JSON and TOML...but with macros!

> _Similar to how JSON is pronounced "J-son", ZOMB is pronounced "zom-B" ðŸ§Ÿ._

## Why use a ZOMB file?

1. No more unwieldy repetition
2. Simple, intuitive, and convenient
3. Easy conversion to other popular file formats

## General Rules, Guidelines, and Definitions

- ZOMB files are UTF-8 encoded text files
- ZOMB files typically have a `.zomb` extension
- "Whitespace" is defined as a tab (U+0009) or a space (U+0020)
- "Newline" is defined as an LF (U+000A) or a CRLF (U+000D U+000A)
- Whitespace and newlines are ignored unless stated otherwise
- Commas as separators are optional - see [Commas](#commas)

## Key-Value Pairs

```zomb
key = value
```

A key-value pair associates a key (which is a string) with a value.

> _Keys at the same level, must be unique._

> _Using `=` as the separator is taken from the [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file format._


### Value Types

There are only four types of values:

- [String](#strings)
- [Object](#objects)
- [Array](#arrays)
- [Macro Expression](#using-a-macro) (see [Macros](#macros))

## Strings

Strings can be simple and yet they have plenty of complicated scenarios. ZOMB files deal with this by placing strings in three categories:

- [Bare String](#bare-strings): A string containing no special delimiters
- [Quoted String](#quoted-strings): A string that may contain special delimiters and escape sequences
- [Raw String](#raw-strings): A string that may contain any characters with no restrictions

### Bare Strings

```zomb
key = a_bare_string
```

```zomb
key = not a bare string  // this is an error!
```

A bare string may contain any Unicode code point except any of these special delimiters:

- Unicode control characters (U+0000 through U+001F)
- ` `, `,`, `.`, `"`, `\` (U+0020, U+002C, U+002E, U+0022, U+005C)
- `=`, `$`, `%` (U+003D, U+0024, U+0025)
- `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}` (U+0028, U+0029, U+005B, U+005D, U+007B, U+007D)

### Quoted Strings

```zomb
key = "a_quoted_string"  // this is fine, but unnecessary
```

```zomb
key = "a quoted string"  // this _is_ necessary
```

```zomb
"this is okay too" = value
```

If you want to include any of the special delimiters not allowed in bare strings, excluding newlines, then you can surround the string with quotation marks -- standard escape sequences apply.

> _Keys (since they're strings too) may also be quoted._

> _The quotation marks (`"`) are only delimiters and are not part of the string's actual value._

### Raw Strings

For fun, let's describe these in a couple of examples:

```zomb
dialog = \\This is a raw string. Raw strings start with '\\' and run to the end
         \\of the line. They continue until either an empty line or another
         \\token is encountered.
         \\
         \\Raw strings may contain any characters without the need for an escape
         \\sequence.
         \\
         \\Newlines are included in raw strings except for the last very last
         \\one.
```

```zomb
dialog = \\blah blah
         \\blah blah

         \\this is an ERROR
```

```zomb
\\Raw strings CANNOT
\\be used as keys
= value
```

> _The leading backslashes (`\\`) are only delimiters and are not part of the string's actual value._

> _Using `\\` as the delimiter is taken from the [Zig](https://ziglang.org) programming language._

### Objects

```zomb
file = {
    type = ZOMB
    path = "/home/zooce/passwords.zomb"  // DON'T STORE YOUR PASSWORDS LIKE THIS!
}
```

Objects group a set of [key-value](#key-value-pairs) pairs, inside a pair of curly braces.

> _Keys in the same object, must be unique._

### Arrays

```zomb
"people jobs" = [
    Hacker
    Dishwasher
    "Dog Walker"
]
```

Arrays group a set of [values](#value-types), inside square brackets.

## Macros

Macros are the special sauce of ZOMB files. They allow you to write reusable strings, objects, and arrays. Let's see an example:

```zomb
$chuck = "Chuck Norris"
$jobs = [ Hacker Dishwasher "Dog Walker" ]
$names = {
    god = Thor
    file = ZOMB
    "the best" = $chuck
}
$person(name, job) = {  // sometimes commas are nice (still not required though)
    name = %name
    job = %job
}

people = [
    $person($names.file, $jobs.0)
    $person($names.god, $jobs.1)
    $person($names."the best", $jobs.2)
    $person(Zooce "Software Engineer")
]
```

There's a lot going on there, but I bet you already kind of get it, don't you?

### Defining a Macro

Macros are defined just like key-value pairs, but with some special rules.

1. Macro keys can be either a bare string or a quoted string, with a leading dollar sign (`$`).
2. Macros can have a set of parameters, declared after the key inside a set of parentheses. _An empty set of parentheses is **invalid**._
3. Parameters can be used as values inside the macro's value by placing a percent sign (`%`) before the parameter name. This eliminates the need for complicated scoping rules.
4. If your macro does have parameters, each parameter _must_ be used at least once in the macro's value. _This is to prevent you from doing unnecessary things_.
4. Recursion in macro definitions is forbidden. Here are a couple of examples:
    ```zomb
    $name = $name  // not cool
    ```

    ```zomb
    $macro1(p1 p2) = {
        this = %p1
        that = $macro2(%p2) // this uses `$macro1` -- forbidden
    }
    $macro2(a) = $macro1(a, 5)
    ```

    ```zomb
    $okay(param) = [ 1 2 %param 3 ]

    // this _is_ okay, because it is not recursion
    my_key = $okay($okay(4))
    ```

### Using a Macro

To use a macro as a value (called a "Macro Expression"), you specify its key (including the `$`).

```zomb
$name = Gene

names = [
    Fred
    Kara
    $name  // easy
    Tommy
]
```

If the macro has parameters, you pass in a value for each. Parameter values can be any type.

```zomb
$person(name, job) = {
    name = %name
    job = %job
}

"cool person" = $person(Zooce, { type = Dishwasher, pay = 100000 })
```

If the macro's value is an object or an array, you can access individual keys or indexes (and even the keys or indexes of nested objects and arrays) by following the macro expression with one or more access patterns like `.key` or `.2` for example.

> _You may **NOT** access individual keys or indexes of parameter values. Why? Because you pass them in when using a macro expression. This is to prevent you from doing unnecessary things._

```zomb
$person(name, job) = {
    name = %name
    job = {
        title = %job
        pay = "1,000,000"
        coworkers = [
            Lindsay
            Kai
            Penny
            Maeve
            Xena
        ]
    }
}

last_coworker = $person(Zooce Dishwasher).job.coworkers.3
```

## Comments

You've already seen comments in the previous examples, but now you know that comments are a real thing!

```zomb
// this is a comment on its own line

hello = goodbye // this is a comment at the end of a line

key = [ // comments can be pretty much anywhere
    1 2 3
]
```

Comments start with `//` and run to the end of the line.

## And that's it!

So, what do you think? Like it? Hate it? Either way, I hope you at least enjoyed learning about this little file format, and I appreciate you taking the time!
